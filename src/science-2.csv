","In December 2014, Estonia became the first nation to open its digital borders to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to apply to become an e-Resident. Estonian e-Residency is essentially a commercial initiative. The e-ID issued to Estonian e-Residents enables commercial activities with the public and private sectors. It does not provide citizenship in its traditional sense, and the e-ID provided to e-Residents is not a travel document. However, in many ways it is an international ‘passport’ to the virtual world. E-Residency is a profound change and the recent announcement that the Estonian government is now partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-Residents based on blockchain technology is of significance. The application of blockchain to e-Residency has the potential to fundamentally change the way identity information is controlled and authenticated. This paper examines the legal, policy, and technical implications of this development.

","An analysis of some of the recent blockchain networks is presented to determine if they satisfy Metcalfe’s Law, as has been shown for some online social media networks. The value of the network was modeled based on the price of the digital currency in use on the network, and the number of users by the number of unique addresses each day that engage in transactions on the network. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash networks were analyzed. The analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by Metcalfe's Law, which identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes, or end users. A new network model was also presented that shows the value to be proportional to the exponential of the root of the number of users participating in the network, and shows good agreement as well. Conditions for determining critical mass based on the new model were also presented. Finally, the potential for identifying value bubbles that can be spotted as deviations in value from the model was discussed and illustrated using the data from one of the networks. Those value bubbles show up where repeated extremely high value increases are not accompanied by any commensurate increase in the number of participating users, or any other development that could give rise to the higher value.

","In the context of the ‘selfish-mine’ strategy proposed by Eyal and Sirer, we study the effect of communication delay on the evolution of the Bitcoin blockchain. First, we use a simplified Markov model that tracks the contrasting states of belief about the blockchain of a small pool of dishonest miners and the ‘rest of the community’ to establish that the use of block-hiding strategies, such as selfish-mine, causes the rate of production of orphan blocks to increase. Then we use a spatial Poisson process model to study values of Eyal and Sirer’s parameter γ , which denotes the proportion of the honest community that mines on a previously-secret block released by the pool in response to the mining of a block by the honest community. Finally, we use discrete-event simulation to study the behaviour of a network of Bitcoin miners, a proportion of which is colluding in using the selfish-mine strategy, under the assumption that there is a delay in the communication of information between miners. The models indicate that both the dishonest and the honest miners were worse off than they would have been if no dishonest mining were present, and that it is possible for the mining community to detect block-hiding behaviour, such as that used in selfish-mine, by monitoring the rate of production of orphan blocks.

","Abstract: Mention the word ‘blockchain’ to most people and, assuming that they've heard of it at all, they will most likely associate it with Bitcoin, or perhaps another crypto-currency. As a decentralised, cryptographically authenticated record of transactions, the blockchain is the key concept that makes Bitcoin feasible. Yet, as Patrick Hubbard, technical product marketing director at SolarWinds, explains in this interview, the same concept has applications far beyond the contentious world of alternative currencies – in fact, far beyond finance altogether.

","The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest web evolution that incorporates billions of devices that are owned by different organisations and people who are deploying and using them for their own purposes. IoT-enabled harnessing of the information that is provided by federations of such IoT devices (which are often referred to as IoT things) provides unprecedented opportunities to solve internet-scale problems that have been too big and too difficult to tackle before. Just like other web-based information systems, IoT must also deal with the plethora of Cyber Security and privacy threats that currently disrupt organisations and can potentially hold the data of entire industries and even countries for ransom. To realise its full potential, IoT must deal effectively with such threats and ensure the security and privacy of the information collected and distilled from IoT devices. However, IoT presents several unique challenges that make the application of existing security and privacy techniques difficult. This is because IoT solutions encompass a variety of security and privacy solutions for protecting such IoT data on the move and in store at the device layer, the IoT infrastructure/platform layer, and the IoT application layer. Therefore, ensuring end-to-end privacy across these three IoT layers is a grand challenge in IoT. In this paper, we tackle the IoT privacy preservation problem. In particular, we propose innovative techniques for privacy preservation of IoT data, introduce a privacy preserving IoT Architecture, and also describe the implementation of an efficient proof of concept system that utilises all these to ensure that IoT data remains private. The proposed privacy preservation techniques utilise multiple IoT cloud data stores to protect the privacy of data collected from IoT. The proposed privacy preserving IoT Architecture and proof of concept implementation are based on extensions of OpenIoT - a widely used open source platform for IoT application development. Experimental evaluations are also provided to validate the efficiency and performance outcomes of the proposed privacy preserving techniques and architecture.

One of the most important drawbacks of LEZs is the citizens’ risk to be tracked by means of their interactions with the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system in use; another relevant problem is the significant error percentage on the detection of fraudulent drivers. The former shortcoming clearly affects the peace of mind of users regarding their privacy. The latter represents an important disadvantage for any entity willing to employ resources on managing a LEZ. In this article, a new ERP system specifically designed for cities with Low-Emission Zones is proposed. The new scheme is user-centric by design, in the sense that preserving the privacy of honest drivers is a fundamental objective. Regarding fraudulent drivers, the proposed system is able to detect them and revoke their anonymity.

","Information and communications technology (ICT) is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or application, encompassing: radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems, and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated with them, such as videoconferencing and distance learning. Traditional and conventional approaches to the design, implementation, and validation of ICT systems typically deal with one core system concern or two system concerns at a time, for example, the functional correctness or reliability of an enterprise system, or security and privacy of a database. Additional aspects are often addressed by a separate engineering activity. This separation of concerns has led to system engineering practices that are not designed to reflect, detect, or manage the interdependencies of such aspects, for example, the interplay between security and safety in modern car electronics, or between security, privacy, and reliability in connected medical devices. Current trends and innovation in ICT, however, suggest a convergence of disciplines and risk domains in order to deal effectively and predictively with such interdependencies. But due to the inherent complexity of such interdependencies and the dynamic operational environments, identification and mitigation of composite risks in systems remains a challenge. The environment that requires risk management and mitigation be a central and integral part of engineering methods for future ICT systems. To address the requirements of the modern computing environment, we need a new approach to risk, where risk modeling is included in design as its integral part. In this chapter, we identify some of the key challenges and issues that a vision of risk engineering brings to current engineering practice; notably, issues of risk composition, the multidisciplinary nature of risk, the design, development, and use of risk metrics, and the need for an extensible risk language. The chapter provides an initial view on the foundational mechanisms we need to build in order to support the vision of risk engineering: risk ontology, risk modeling and composition, and risk language.

The blockchain is a digital ledger that records every bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred. The users’ privacy is preserved in the bitcoin exchange by using the blockchain. In some application scenarios, it is important to show the buyer’s assets strength in order to avoid the troublemakers. At the same time, it is also necessary to preserve the buyer’s assets privacy. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of DV-PoA (designated-verifier proof of assets) for bitcoin exchange. Since bitcoin exchange’s signature takes use of the elliptic curve cryptography, we design the first concrete DV-PoA scheme by using elliptic curve cryptography in order to be consistent with it. Then, we prove the security of the proposed DV-PoA scheme. After that, we analyze its efficiency from the two cases: theory and implementation. Our analysis shows that the designed DV-PoA scheme is provably secure and efficient.

Smart contracts are disintermediated and generally transparent in nature, offering the promise of increased commercial efficiency, lower transaction and legal costs, and anonymous transacting. The business world is actively investigating the use of blockchain technology for various commercial purposes. Whilst questions surround the security and reliability of this technology, and the negative impact it may have upon traditional intermediaries, there are equally significant concerns that smart contracts will encounter considerable difficulty adapting to current legal frameworks regulating contracts across jurisdictions. This article considers the potential issues with legal and practical enforceability that arise from the use of smart contracts within both civil and common law jurisdictions.

","Generation from distributed renewable energy sources is constantly increasing. Due to its volatility, the integration of this non-controllable generation poses severe challenges to the current energy system. Thus, ensuring a reliable balance of energy generation and consumption becomes increasingly demanding. In our approach to tackle these challenges, we suggest that consumers and prosumers can trade self-produced energy in a peer-to-peer fashion on microgrid energy markets. Thus, consumers and prosumers can keep profits from energy trading within their community. This provides incentives for investments in renewable generation plants and for locally balancing supply and demand. Hence, both financial as well as socio-economic incentives for the integration and expansion of locally produced renewable energy are provided. The efficient operation of these microgrid energy markets requires innovative information systems for integrating the market participants in a user-friendly and comprehensive way. To this end, we present the concept of a blockchain-based microgrid energy market without the need for central intermediaries. We derive seven market components as a framework for building efficient microgrid energy markets. Then, we evaluate the Brooklyn Microgrid project as a case study of such a market according to the required components. We show that the Brooklyn Microgrid fully satisfies three and partially fulfills an additional three of the seven components. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that blockchains are an eligible technology to operate decentralized microgrid energy markets. However, current regulation does not allow to run local peer-to-peer energy markets in most countries and, hence, the seventh component cannot be satisfied yet.

","The advances in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) brought many benefits to the healthcare area, specially to digital storage of patients’ health records. However, it is still a challenge to have a unified viewpoint of patients’ health history, because typically health data is scattered among different health organizations. Furthermore, there are several standards for these records, some of them open and others proprietary. Usually health records are stored in databases within health organizations and rarely have external access. This situation applies mainly to cases where patients’ data are maintained by healthcare providers, known as EHRs (Electronic Health Records). In case of PHRs (Personal Health Records), in which patients by definition can manage their health records, they usually have no control over their data stored in healthcare providers’ databases. Thereby, we envision two main challenges regarding PHR context: first, how patients could have a unified view of their scattered health records, and second, how healthcare providers can access up-to-date data regarding their patients, even though changes occurred elsewhere. For addressing these issues, this work proposes a model named OmniPHR, a distributed model to integrate PHRs, for patients and healthcare providers use. The scientific contribution is to propose an architecture model to support a distributed PHR, where patients can maintain their health history in an unified viewpoint, from any device anywhere. Likewise, for healthcare providers, the possibility of having their patients data interconnected among health organizations. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the model in maintaining health records distributed in an architecture model that promotes a unified view of PHR with elasticity and scalability of the solution.

","In this paper a trust-based coalition formation game is proposed to design opportunistic hop-by-hop forwarding schemes, relying on cellular Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, to enhance content uploading services. The User Equipments (UEs) are sources of data to be uploaded to a cellular base station (eNodeB) and are assumed to be rational self-interested players as they aim at maximizing their own utility. To this aim, the UEs cooperate to opportunistically implement proximity-based data exchanges where the presence of malicious nodes in the network is a constant threat for the successful cooperation. To cope with this issue, reliability and reputation notions are considered to model the level of trust among the players. Taking inspiration from the recent Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm, social-awareness of the devices is spotted as a key parameter to effectively define the wished trustworthiness. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through a simulative analysis showing a relevant reduction in the data loss due to malicious behavior of a subset of the devices. In particular, up to 86% reduction in terms of data loss is obtained with respect to the case where the proposed trust model is not implemented. Moreover, the trust-based and social-aware solution also guarantees higher gains in terms of the uploading time for the devices taking part of the cooperative D2D-based content uploading.

","This paper aims to identify the likely determinants for cryptocurrency value formation, including for that of bitcoin. Due to Bitcoin’s growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance, it has become increasingly important to try to understand the factors that influence its value formation. Presently, the value of all bitcoins in existence represent approximately $7 billion, and more than $60 million of notional value changes hands each day. Having grown rapidly over the past few years, there is now a developing but vibrant marketplace for bitcoin, and a recognition of digital currencies as an emerging asset class. Not only is there a listed and over-the-counter market for bitcoin and other digital currencies, but also an emergent derivatives market. As such, the ability to value bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies is becoming critical to its establishment as a legitimate financial asset.
",
"Using cross-sectional empirical data examining 66 of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, a regression model was estimated that points to three main drivers of cryptocurrency value: the level of competition in the network of producers, the rate of unit production, and the difficulty of algorithm used to “mine” for the cryptocurrency. These amount to relative differences in the cost of production of one digital currency over another at the margin, pointing to differences in relative cost of production – electricity goes in, cryptocurrency comes out. Using that as a starting point, a no-arbitrage situation is established for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies followed by the formalization of a cost of production model to determine the fair value of a bitcoin.

These requirements manifest as a set of design principles for each of the layers in an IoT ecosystem, from hardware to cloud services. This paper gives concrete guidelines learned from implementing and deploying a full-stack synergistic IoT platform. We address hardware design concerns and present a reference platform, Firestorm. Upon this platform, we demonstrate firmware and personal-area networking concerns and solutions. Moving out towards larger scales we address local service discovery and syndication, and show how these principles carry through to global operation where security concerns dominate.

","The decentralized digital currency Bitcoin presents an anonymous alternative to the centralized banking system and indeed enjoys widespread and increasing adoption. Recent works, however, show how users can be reidentified and their payments linked based on Bitcoin’s most central element, the blockchain, a public ledger of all transactions. Thus, many regard Bitcoin’s central promise of financial privacy as broken.
",
"In this paper, we propose CoinParty, an efficient decentralized mixing service that allows users to reestablish their financial privacy in Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. CoinParty, through a novel combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures, takes a unique place in the design space of mixing services, combining the advantages of previously proposed centralized and decentralized mixing services in one system. Our prototype implementation of CoinParty scales to large numbers of users and achieves anonymity sets by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain. CoinParty can easily be deployed by any individual group of users, i.e., independent of any third parties, or provided as a commercial or voluntary service, e.g., as a community service by privacy-aware organizations.

The defined model leverages the Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme to attach sticky policies to the data. This paper also shows several security features and functions that are suitable for secure data sharing in the cloud.

","RFID/NFC technology is widely spread nowadays and applications can be found in our everyday life, for example, in payment, transportation, logistics, healthcare, and access control. State-of-the-art contactless and passive authentication solutions implement relatively large coils outside of the chip. Therefore, the minimum size is in the order of a few square centimeters, which limits their use for tagging of certain small-sized goods. On top of that, those miniaturized solutions which are available today provide only limited security measures.

"Here we introduce miniaturized system-in-package contactless authentication devices. This novel solution integrates Infineon Technologies’ CIPURSETMmove IC, which is a state-of-the-art security solution featuring an open security standard, into embedded Wafer Level Ball Grid Array (eWLB) packages, together with HF-antennas, ferrites, as well as discrete elements that improve HF-coupling characteristics.

"The presented devices provide better HF-coupling characteristics than Coil-on-Chip approaches, which also enable verification of authenticity of tagged products through NFC-enabled smart phones. Thanks to the miniaturized package sizes of 3 × 3 mm, integration into high-priced products, casings, consumable materials, etc., can be achieved in a discreet way. Furthermore, the integrated CIPURSETM chip enables not only the anti-counterfeiting use-case, but also micropayment, ticketing, access control, and password storage in a secured way. Therefore, this miniaturized contactless authentication solution will open up whole new fields of applications.

In SPFP, a ticket containing authentication materials is used for fast handover authentication when an MN changes its attachment point. Moreover, the MN’s anonymity is supported for preserving location privacy. Detailed operations of initial authentication and handover authentication are presented with message flows.

Specifically, the effects of cyber-physical attacks, and potential means for detecting them, are explored. To explore the potential implications of such an attack, a case study was conducted to evaluate the ability of human subjects to detect and diagnose a cyber-physical attack on the STL file of a test specimen.

","Entangled cloud storage (Aspnes et al., ESORICS 2004) enables a set of clients to “entangle” their files into a single clew to be stored by a (potentially malicious) cloud provider. The entanglement makes it impossible to modify or delete significant part of the clew without affecting all files encoded in the clew. A clew keeps the files in it private but still lets each client recover his own data by interacting with the cloud provider; no cooperation from other clients is needed. At the same time, the cloud provider is discouraged from altering or overwriting any significant part of the clew as this will imply that none of the clients can recover their files.
",
"We put forward the first simulation-based security definition for entangled cloud storage, in the framework of universal composability (Canetti, 2001). We then construct a protocol satisfying our security definition, relying on an entangled encoding scheme based on privacy-preserving polynomial interpolation; entangled encodings were originally proposed by Aspnes et al. as useful tools for the purpose of data entanglement. As a contribution of independent interest we revisit the security notions for entangled encodings, putting forward stronger definitions than previous work (that for instance did not consider collusion between clients and the cloud provider).
",,,
"Protocols for entangled cloud storage find application in the cloud setting, where clients store their files on a remote server and need to be ensured that the cloud provider will not modify or delete their data illegitimately. Current solutions, e.g., based on Provable Data Possession and Proof of Retrievability, require the server to be challenged regularly to provide evidence that the clients’ files are stored at a given time. Entangled cloud storage provides an alternative approach where any single client operates implicitly on behalf of all others, i.e., as long as one client’s files are intact, the entire remote database continues to be safe and unblemished.

","Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have ignited intense discussions.

In this paper, we conduct a theory-driven empirical study of the Bitcoin exchange rate (against USD) determination, taking into consideration both technology and economic factors. To address co-integration in a mix of stationary and non-stationary time series, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with a bounds test approach in the estimation. Meanwhile, to detect potential structural changes, we estimate our empirical model on two periods separated by the closure of Mt. Gox (one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets). According to our analysis, in the short term, the Bitcoin exchange rate adjusts to changes in economic fundamentals and market conditions. The long-term Bitcoin exchange rate is more sensitive to economic fundamentals and less sensitive to technological factors after Mt. Gox closed. We also identify a significant impact of mining technology and a decreasing significance of mining difficulty in the Bitcoin exchange price determination.

","Fog computing can be viewed as an extension of cloud computing that enables transactions and resources at the edge of the network. In the paradigms of fog computing, the fog user (outsourcer) with resource-constraint devices can outsource the distributed computation tasks to the untrusted fog nodes (workers) and pays for them. Recently, plenty of research work has been done on fair payments. However, all existing solutions adopt the traditional e-cash system to generate payment token, which needs a trusted authority (i.e. a bank) to prevent double-spending. The bank will become the bottleneck of the payments system. In this paper, we propose a new fair payment scheme for outsourcing computations based on Bitcoin. Due to the advantages of Bitcoin syntax, the users can transact directly without needing a bank. Besides, the proposed construction can guarantee that no matter how a malicious outsourcer behaves, the honest workers will be paid if he completed the computing tasks.

","Bitcoin is a digital currency in which the need for a trusted third party is avoided. Instead, this digital currency is based on the concept of ‘proof of work’ allowing users to execute payments by digitally signing their transactions. Since electronic files can be duplicated, fraudulent transactions in the form of double-spend attacks – where users spend the same money at least twice – can happen. This paper is about attack models that can assign possible time advantage to attacker agents in the Bitcoin network. In particular, this paper presents: (i) two attack models in which partial advancement towards block production can be influenced by time and not only by the hashpower used to produce blocks of hashes, and (ii) algorithmic experimentation comparing these models against existing well-known hashrate-based attack models that do not consider time advantage. As a conclusion, this paper presents evidence on the fact that advantages are not negligible for cases in which an attacker has had enough time for secretly mining fraudulent blocks or significant control over the network. Also, the models presented in this paper help in supporting previous claims in the literature about how to correctly model and detect double-spend attacks in the Bitcoin network.

Both of them are embedded into wavelet medium frequency coefficients by using the proposed group-based wavelet quantization method. On the authentication side, after identifying the tampered regions, the proposed method can recover the tampered face images by using the hidden information watermark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermark scheme has high localization accuracy and robustness comparing with the existing techniques, and the recovered PCA coefficients can be used to reconstruct the Eigen-face image or be directly used for recognition system.

","Industry 4.0, referred to as the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, also known as “smart manufacturing”, “industrial internet” or “integrated industry”, is currently a much-discussed topic that supposedly has the potential to affect entire industries by transforming the way goods are designed, manufactured, delivered and payed. This paper seeks to discuss the opportunities of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, since implications are expected in this field. The authors pursue the goal of shedding light on the young and mostly undiscovered topic of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, thus following a conceptual research approach. At first, a logistics-oriented Industry 4.0 application model as well as the core components of Industry 4.0 are presented. Different logistics scenarios illustrate potential implications in a practice-oriented manner and are discussed with industrial experts. The studies reveal opportunities in terms of decentralisation, self-regulation and efficiency. Moreover, it becomes apparent that the concept of Industry 4.0 still lacks a clear understanding and is not fully established in practice yet. The investigations demonstrate potential Industry 4.0 implications in the context of Just-in-Time/Just-in-Sequence and cross-company Kanban systems in a precise manner. Practitioners could use the described scenarios as a reference to foster their own Industry 4.0 initiatives, with respect to logistics management.

","Abstract: Crypto-currencies are an application of technology that severely divides opinion. For some, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin and their ilk are enablers for criminals, terrorists, paedophiles and other undesirables, allowing them to profit from their dark deeds undetected. For others, the ability to buy and sell anonymously and beyond the reach of regulation, taxation and control is a form of freedom.

","Artifact-centric workflows describe possible executions of a business process through constraints expressed from the point of view of the documents exchanged between principals. A sequence of manipulations is deemed valid as long as every document in the workflow follows its prescribed lifecycle at all steps of the process. So far, establishing that a given workflow complies with artifact lifecycles has mostly been done through static verification, or by assuming a centralized access to all artifacts where these constraints can be monitored and enforced. We present in this paper an alternate method of enforcing document lifecycles that requires neither static verification nor single-point access. Rather, the document itself is designed to carry fragments of its history, protected from tampering using hashing and public-key encryption. Any principal involved in the process can verify at any time that the history of a document complies with a given lifecycle. Moreover, the proposed system also enforces access permissions: not all actions are visible to all principals, and one can only modify and verify what one is allowed to observe. These concepts have been implemented in a software library called Artichoke, and empirically tested for performance and scalability.

","The goal of this paper is to analyze the extent to which virtual currencies are regulated under EU financial and economic law, with particular attention to cryptocurrencies. The focus of this paper is put on recent developments regarding anti-money laundering legislation. In the last decade, the EU has adopted several legal frameworks governing different aspects of the payments landscape, most notably regarding payment services and electronic money. However, it remains unclear how virtual currencies – and more in particular cryptocurrencies – fit under those legal frameworks. This paper will first briefly analyze whether core legislation in the fields of payment services and e-money can apply to virtual currencies. Next, and more importantly, the focus will be put on recent developments at the EU level, which aim to bring certain virtual currency service providers under the scope of anti-money laundering rules. While at the moment only such inclusion under anti-money laundering rules appears to be viable, it remains to be seen what the consequences of this evolution are for developments in virtual currencies. This paper provides an analysis of a regulatory issue currently debated by legislators worldwide. In doing so, it aims to provide insights valuable to service providers active in this nascent market.

","Due to the complexity and increasing decentralisation of the energy infrastructure, as well as growing penetration of renewable generation and proliferation of energy prosumers, the way in which energy consumption in buildings is managed must change. Buildings need to be considered as active participants in a complex and wider district-level energy landscape. To achieve this, the authors argue the need for a new generation of energy control systems capable of adapting to near real-time environmental conditions while maximising the use of renewables and minimising energy demand within a district environment. This will be enabled by cloud-based demand-response strategies through advanced data analytics and optimisation, underpinned by semantic data models as demonstrated by the Computational Urban Sustainability Platform, CUSP, prototype presented in this paper. The growing popularity of time of use tariffs and smart, IoT connected devices offer opportunities for Energy Service Companies, ESCo’s, to play a significant role in this new energy landscape. They could provide energy management and cost savings for adaptable users, while meeting energy and CO2 reduction targets. The paper provides a critical review and agenda setting perspective for energy management in buildings and beyond.

It discusses the two specific roles a hacker group member has to be able to fulfill, as a social reformer and as a combatant. The type of individual sought after is strongly developed both intellectually and ideologically. Besides that he or she will not shy away from taking responsibility and fighting on the digital forefront during uprisings, unrests, and conflicts. These individuals are influential on their own, but when organized in a hacker group they can rise to unprecedented heights. The organization of the hacker group consists of the following disciplines: leadership, recruiting, infrastructure, engineering, and external communication.

","Context: Process views support the paradigm of Business Process Outsourcing, in which providers perform business processes on behalf of their clients. A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non-confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views.
",
"Objective:
","This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent.
",,
"Method:
","We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service-oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture.
",,
"Results:
","The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration.
",,
"Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process.

","Computing is increasingly ubiquitous, with everyday items including smartphones, cars, clothes and household appliances gaining increasingly sophisticated computing and communication capacities. With the development of the Internet of Things, it is just a matter of time before devices have to collaborate and compete with each other, in order to provide better services to mankind.
",
"These embedded software systems are increasingly autonomous and connected, and can thus be modeled as multiagent systems (MAS). Only 30 years ago it was science fiction that over a billion people will exchange billions of e-mails on a daily basis. Today a scenario of millions of collaborating agents sometimes embedded in gadgets and appliances, sometimes in form of networked and big data services, may also sound futuristic. However given the current rate of development in electronics, we will soon have to manage large scale MAS where millions of agents exist, collaborate and compete. Organization theory provides the necessary methodology to approach complex systems in order to design, implement and strategically manage them towards success.

","In Electronic Marketplaces (EMs), a number of unknown entities can interact to conclude purchase actions. Interactions are, usually, between buyers and sellers. Both groups of entities (e.g., buyers, sellers) aim to acquire items in the most profitable price. The discussed interactions are realized in the form of negotiations over a number of items characteristics. In this paper, we focus on the buyer side and deal with automated multi-issue concurrent negotiations. Such negotiations are between buyers and multiple sellers having in their property specific items. Each buyer negotiates with a number of sellers trying to achieve the most profitable value for a number of items’ characteristics. We propose an optimization model for achieving the maximum possible utility. Our method adopts the principles of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm that offers a number of advantages compared to other Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization – PSO). The buyer, based on a number of threads, tries to find the optimal agreement when negotiating with a group of sellers. Every agreement, realized with a specific seller, results a utility for the buyer concluded over a weighted scheme on the items characteristics. Each thread adopts a weights adaptation model for optimizing the utility. A set of experiments reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model. We also report on a comparison assessment between the proposed method and other efforts found in the respective literature.

","Cloud computing systems provide the facilities to make application services resilient against failures of individual computing resources. However, resiliency is typically limited by a cloud consumer’s use and operation of cloud resources. In particular, system operations have been reported as one of the leading causes of system-wide outages. This applies specifically to DevOps operations, such as backup, redeployment, upgrade, customized scaling, and migration – which are executed at much higher frequencies now than a decade ago. We address this problem by proposing a novel approach to detect errors in the execution of these kinds of operations, in particular for rolling upgrade operations. Our regression-based approach leverages the correlation between operations’ activity logs and the effect of operation activities on cloud resources. First, we present a metric selection approach based on regression analysis. Second, the output of a regression model of selected metrics is used to derive assertion specifications, which can be used for runtime verification of running operations. We have conducted a set of experiments with different configurations of an upgrade operation on Amazon Web Services, with and without randomly injected faults to demonstrate the utility of our new approach.

","The calibration of a local volatility models to a given set of option prices is a classical problem of mathematical finance. It was considered in multiple papers where various solutions were proposed. In this paper an extension of the approach proposed in Lipton, Sepp 2011 is developed by (i) replacing a piecewise constant local variance construction with a piecewise linear one, and (ii) allowing non-zero interest rates and dividend yields. Our approach remains analytically tractable; it combines the Laplace transform in time with an analytical solution of the resulting spatial equations in terms of Kummer's degenerate hypergeometric functions.
