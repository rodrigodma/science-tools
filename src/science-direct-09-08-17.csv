","The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest web evolution that incorporates billions of devices that are owned by different organisations and people who are deploying and using them for their own purposes. IoT-enabled harnessing of the information that is provided by federations of such IoT devices (which are often referred to as IoT things) provides unprecedented opportunities to solve internet-scale problems that have been too big and too difficult to tackle before. Just like other web-based information systems, IoT must also deal with the plethora of Cyber Security and privacy threats that currently disrupt organisations and can potentially hold the data of entire industries and even countries for ransom. To realise its full potential, IoT must deal effectively with such threats and ensure the security and privacy of the information collected and distilled from IoT devices. However, IoT presents several unique challenges that make the application of existing security and privacy techniques difficult. This is because IoT solutions encompass a variety of security and privacy solutions for protecting such IoT data on the move and in store at the device layer, the IoT infrastructure/platform layer, and the IoT application layer. Therefore, ensuring end-to-end privacy across these three IoT layers is a grand challenge in IoT. In this paper, we tackle the IoT privacy preservation problem. In particular, we propose innovative techniques for privacy preservation of IoT data, introduce a privacy preserving IoT Architecture, and also describe the implementation of an efficient proof of concept system that utilises all these to ensure that IoT data remains private. The proposed privacy preservation techniques utilise multiple IoT cloud data stores to protect the privacy of data collected from IoT. The proposed privacy preserving IoT Architecture and proof of concept implementation are based on extensions of OpenIoT - a widely used open source platform for IoT application development. Experimental evaluations are also provided to validate the efficiency and performance outcomes of the proposed privacy preserving techniques and architecture.

","This position paper is a reflective look at the state of Human-Centred Security &amp; Privacy (HCSP) research and the paradigms that have informed and driven the research. It is important to reflect and examine, because, as Harrison et al. [1] argue, with respect to HCI, “the lack of clarity about the epistemological distinctions between paradigms is a limiting factor in the development of the field” (p. 1). We discuss the current state of play and then suggest possible explanations and suggestions for the way forward for our research field. This paper aims to prompt a discussion of the directions HCSP should take, and ways we could deploy to encourage maturation of the field.

","In this paper a trust-based coalition formation game is proposed to design opportunistic hop-by-hop forwarding schemes, relying on cellular Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, to enhance content uploading services. The User Equipments (UEs) are sources of data to be uploaded to a cellular base station (eNodeB) and are assumed to be rational self-interested players as they aim at maximizing their own utility. To this aim, the UEs cooperate to opportunistically implement proximity-based data exchanges where the presence of malicious nodes in the network is a constant threat for the successful cooperation. To cope with this issue, reliability and reputation notions are considered to model the level of trust among the players. Taking inspiration from the recent Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm, social-awareness of the devices is spotted as a key parameter to effectively define the wished trustworthiness. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through a simulative analysis showing a relevant reduction in the data loss due to malicious behavior of a subset of the devices. In particular, up to 86% reduction in terms of data loss is obtained with respect to the case where the proposed trust model is not implemented. Moreover, the trust-based and social-aware solution also guarantees higher gains in terms of the uploading time for the devices taking part of the cooperative D2D-based content uploading.

He starts a war with a stick, you get a spear; he counters with a musket, you upgrade to a cannon; he develops a tank, you split the atom. While the consequences of organisational cyber-security breaches may not be as earth-shatteringly dramatic today, the arms race of centuries ago continues into the digital sphere of today.

These requirements manifest as a set of design principles for each of the layers in an IoT ecosystem, from hardware to cloud services. This paper gives concrete guidelines learned from implementing and deploying a full-stack synergistic IoT platform. We address hardware design concerns and present a reference platform, Firestorm. Upon this platform, we demonstrate firmware and personal-area networking concerns and solutions. Moving out towards larger scales we address local service discovery and syndication, and show how these principles carry through to global operation where security concerns dominate.

This research is focused on a secure construct that would integrate with other cloud ready standards and products for data protection. Sticky policies, recently considered as one of the preferred cloud data protection techniques, are here combined with standardized OOXML data package. The defined model leverages the Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme to attach sticky policies to the data. This paper also shows several security features and functions that are suitable for secure data sharing in the cloud. Technologies used for proposed construction are not new, therefore only their unique combination with AES key derived from XACML sticky policy via IBE and OOXML wrapper constitutes novelty of this research.

SPAM aimed at providing high security properties while optimizing handover latency and computation overhead, but as pointed out in this paper SPAM is vulnerable to replay and malicious insider attacks as well as the compromise of a single node. In this paper, a new Security Protocol for Fast PMIPv6, called SPFP, is proposed that provides a ticket-based secure handover for mobile nodes (MNs). In SPFP, a ticket containing authentication materials is used for fast handover authentication when an MN changes its attachment point. Moreover, the MN’s anonymity is supported for preserving location privacy. Detailed operations of initial authentication and handover authentication are presented with message flows. The formal security analysis of SPFP is provided with results of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis.

The comment was somewhat tongue in cheek, but the truth is that passwords have become one of the weakest links in our security chain, compounded by our inability to memorise the long and complex passcodes demanded by our security systems (see box on page 6).

In this paper, we propose a face image protection scheme based on semi-fragile self-recoverable watermarking. Authentication watermark is generated from the singular value decomposition (SVD) coefficients for each image block, and information watermark is generated from the principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients. Both of them are embedded into wavelet medium frequency coefficients by using the proposed group-based wavelet quantization method. On the authentication side, after identifying the tampered regions, the proposed method can recover the tampered face images by using the hidden information watermark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermark scheme has high localization accuracy and robustness comparing with the existing techniques, and the recovered PCA coefficients can be used to reconstruct the Eigen-face image or be directly used for recognition system.

","Industry 4.0, referred to as the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, also known as “smart manufacturing”, “industrial internet” or “integrated industry”, is currently a much-discussed topic that supposedly has the potential to affect entire industries by transforming the way goods are designed, manufactured, delivered and payed. This paper seeks to discuss the opportunities of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, since implications are expected in this field. The authors pursue the goal of shedding light on the young and mostly undiscovered topic of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, thus following a conceptual research approach. At first, a logistics-oriented Industry 4.0 application model as well as the core components of Industry 4.0 are presented. Different logistics scenarios illustrate potential implications in a practice-oriented manner and are discussed with industrial experts. The studies reveal opportunities in terms of decentralisation, self-regulation and efficiency. Moreover, it becomes apparent that the concept of Industry 4.0 still lacks a clear understanding and is not fully established in practice yet. The investigations demonstrate potential Industry 4.0 implications in the context of Just-in-Time/Just-in-Sequence and cross-company Kanban systems in a precise manner. Practitioners could use the described scenarios as a reference to foster their own Industry 4.0 initiatives, with respect to logistics management.

","Context: Process views support the paradigm of Business Process Outsourcing, in which providers perform business processes on behalf of their clients. A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non-confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views.
","Objective: This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent.
"
"Method: We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service-oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture.
","Results: The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration.
","Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process.

","Computing is increasingly ubiquitous, with everyday items including smartphones, cars, clothes and household appliances gaining increasingly sophisticated computing and communication capacities. With the development of the Internet of Things, it is just a matter of time before devices have to collaborate and compete with each other, in order to provide better services to mankind. These embedded software systems are increasingly autonomous and connected, and can thus be modeled as multiagent systems (MAS). Only 30 years ago it was science fiction that over a billion people will exchange billions of e-mails on a daily basis. Today a scenario of millions of collaborating agents sometimes embedded in gadgets and appliances, sometimes in form of networked and big data services, may also sound futuristic. However given the current rate of development in electronics, we will soon have to manage large scale MAS where millions of agents exist, collaborate and compete. Organization theory provides the necessary methodology to approach complex systems in order to design, implement and strategically manage them towards success. In this paper a state-of-the-art on organizational design techniques for large-scale MAS will be presented, missing advancements will be identified and a roadmap for future developments and application scenarios will be provided.

","In Electronic Marketplaces (EMs), a number of unknown entities can interact to conclude purchase actions. Interactions are, usually, between buyers and sellers. Both groups of entities (e.g., buyers, sellers) aim to acquire items in the most profitable price. The discussed interactions are realized in the form of negotiations over a number of items characteristics. In this paper, we focus on the buyer side and deal with automated multi-issue concurrent negotiations. Such negotiations are between buyers and multiple sellers having in their property specific items. Each buyer negotiates with a number of sellers trying to achieve the most profitable value for a number of items’ characteristics. We propose an optimization model for achieving the maximum possible utility. Our method adopts the principles of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm that offers a number of advantages compared to other Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization – PSO). The buyer, based on a number of threads, tries to find the optimal agreement when negotiating with a group of sellers. Every agreement, realized with a specific seller, results a utility for the buyer concluded over a weighted scheme on the items characteristics. Each thread adopts a weights adaptation model for optimizing the utility. A set of experiments reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model. We also report on a comparison assessment between the proposed method and other efforts found in the respective literature.

","Cloud computing systems provide the facilities to make application services resilient against failures of individual computing resources.

In particular, system operations have been reported as one of the leading causes of system-wide outages. This applies specifically to DevOps operations, such as backup, redeployment, upgrade, customized scaling, and migration – which are executed at much higher frequencies now than a decade ago. We address this problem by proposing a novel approach to detect errors in the execution of these kinds of operations, in particular for rolling upgrade operations. Our regression-based approach leverages the correlation between operations’ activity logs and the effect of operation activities on cloud resources. First, we present a metric selection approach based on regression analysis. Second, the output of a regression model of selected metrics is used to derive assertion specifications, which can be used for runtime verification of running operations. We have conducted a set of experiments with different configurations of an upgrade operation on Amazon Web Services, with and without randomly injected faults to demonstrate the utility of our new approach.
